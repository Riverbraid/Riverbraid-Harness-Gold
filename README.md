# ⚓ Riverbraid-Harness-Gold

## 📜 Overview
**Riverbraid-Harness-Gold** is the fail-closed verification harness, byte-floor audits, and stationary sealing. 

It operates within the **Riverbraid Gold Cluster** under a **Fail-Closed** discipline: if any part of the system deviates from its anchored frequency (commit hash), the cluster halts to prevent entropy leakage.

## 🗝️ Core Functions
* Byte-Floor Audits
* Fail-Closed Gating
* Stationary Sealing
* **Institutional Alignment:** Fully compliant with the v1.1.0 stationary mandate.

## 🧬 Stationary State Invariant
The system is anchored in the principle of $dS/dt = 0$ (Zero Entropy Growth).
> "A system is secure if and only if it is in a secure state and all state transitions preserve security." — McLean (1994)

## 🛡️ Governance
This petal is a part of the **Riverbraid Gold v1.1.0** release.
